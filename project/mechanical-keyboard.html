  </header>

  <main>
    <p>A custom split mechanical keyboard designed from scratch—from identifying the problem
    through PCB design, firmware, and planning for manufacturing. The goal was a compact,
    ergonomic keyboard with minimal component count and no compromises on feel.</p>

    <h2>PCB Design</h2>
    <p>Designed the schematic and board layout in KiCad. The key constraint was a reversible
    PCB—a single board that works for both the left and right halves of the split, cutting
    fabrication cost and complexity in half.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>The project followed a full product development cycle: identifying pain points with
    existing keyboards, iterative prototyping and testing, gathering feedback, and designing
    with manufacturing scalability in mind.</p>
