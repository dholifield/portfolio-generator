A custom split mechanical keyboard designed from scratch—from identifying the problem through PCB design, firmware, and planning for manufacturing. The goal was a compact, ergonomic keyboard with minimal component count and no compromises on feel.

## PCB Design

Designed the schematic and board layout in KiCad. The key constraint was a reversible PCB—a single board that works for both the left and right halves of the split, cutting fabrication cost and complexity in half.

## Process

The project followed a full product development cycle: identifying pain points with existing keyboards, iterative prototyping and testing, gathering feedback, and designing with manufacturing scalability in mind.
