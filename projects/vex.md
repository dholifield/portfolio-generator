  Eight years of competitive robotics culminating in the 2024 VEXU World Championship.
  Robot design, manufacturiing, control algorithms, and open-source libraries.
---

I competed in VEX Robotics for eight years across high school and college, representing teams 7701T, BLRS2, and BLRS (Purdue's competitive robotics teams). The work covered the full stack of robot development: mechanical design and CAD, manufacturing, and software.

## Achievements

- 2024 VEXU World Champion
- 2022 VEXU Skills World Champion
- 2020 Kalahari Classic Champion
- 6× world championship qualifiers, 3× world division finalists
- 12× tournament champions, 7× skills champions

## Software

I wrote control algorithms to minimize navigation time and error, including PID controllers and a custom Pure Pursuit variant using linear circle approximation. The system achieved <2" odometry accuracy over 12 feet despite IMU drift limitations.

I also developed and maintain two open-source robot chassis control libraries—[ARMS](https://github.com/purduesigbots/ARMS) and [appa](https://appa.odom.tech/), used by teams beyond our own.

## Hardware

Robots were built using 3D printing, CNC machining, and off-the-shelf parts. Sensors included capacitive encoders, IMUs, color sensors, and vision cameras. Design went through extensive CAD and iterative prototyping before competition.
